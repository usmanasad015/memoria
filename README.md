Project Overview
Memoria allows users to create and manage a collection of memories, timelines, and personal notes. It provides a seamless interface for users to add, update, and view entries with associated multimedia. The back end is implemented using Django, while the front end is built with modern JavaScript frameworks.

Features
User Authentication: User registration, login, and OTP-based verification.
Timeline Creation: Add and manage timeline events with multimedia support.
Memory Storage: Organize and store memories with details, dates, and images.
Responsive UI: Optimized for mobile and desktop use.
Technologies Used
Back End:
Django: For the REST API and server-side logic.
Django REST Framework (DRF): To build RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite: Database for storing user and memory data.
Stripe: Payment processing for premium features (if applicable).
Front End:
React / Vue / Angular: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
HTML5 & CSS3: Structuring and styling the UI.
Bootstrap/Tailwind: For responsive design.
